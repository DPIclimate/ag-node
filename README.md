## Description

The ag-node is an automatic multi-weigh-station for measuring the live-weight of sheep  in remote locations. The station can be situated against a trough for which sheep weights will be recorded as they access feed or water. An in-built LoRaWAN radio sends data (containing live-weight information) back to a local gateway and onto the end user. Additional interfaces are provided, including; SDI-12, I<sub>2</sub>C and OneWire to allow for various sensors to be connected to the device (such as trough level sensors, temperature monitors etc.).
